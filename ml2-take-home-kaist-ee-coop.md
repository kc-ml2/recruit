# ML2 Take-home project

## Review, re-implement, and reproduce a research/development project.

### What to do
* Pick one project that can demonstrate your interest and experience. 
  * If you are interested in developing a deep learning algorithm, it can be one of the papers from the list below or any other paper you like.
  * Or any project of similar complexity as the papers related to one of the following topics:
* Review and summarize the project.
* Re-implement the project from scratch. 
  * Feel free to use any material as a reference as long as you cite it; just don't copy-and-paste others’ code snippets. 
  * And it is totally fine to design a project smaller in size/scope than the original one, i.e. reduced number of layers and weights for a deep model, or simpler requirements for a software.
* Set your own target performance and present an experiment showing your work has achieved the desired objective.
  * You don’t have to reproduce the exact result of the original project. Toy tasks defined in the original project are good candidates.

### What to submit 
* A link to a GitHub (or a similar Git hosting service) repository containing a README.md that has
  * a concise but extensive review of the project,
  * a description of the content of the repo,
  * a documentation of how to run the code,
  * showcase examples,
  * and any other materials you want to describe regarding the repo.
